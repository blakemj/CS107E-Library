1. 0x0f = 0000 1111
   0xff = 1111 1111
   (Convert to binary)
   0000 1111 | 1111 1111 = 1111 1111
   (Do the OR  operation)
   1111 1111 = 255
   (Convert to decimal)
   Now, we left shift by 24: 1111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   Converting to hex: 0xff000000
2. V=iR
   3V = i (1.5 K-Ohm resistor)
   i = 3V/1.5 K-Ohm
   i = 2 mA
3. First, to find the number of files and directories contained in the /etc 
   directory, I decided to open a tree of the /etc directory. Since this could
   not be done in Mac OS, I logged to myth and from there by typing the command    "ssh blakemj@myth.stanford.edu" and then I typed "cd /etc" which brought me
   to the directory. Then, I typed "tree /etc" which gave me the tree, and 
   showed at the bottom that there are 468 directories and 3495 files in the 
   /etc directory. I then typed "ls -l" to see more information about the files
   within the directory and saw that the watchdog.conf file contains 1726 bytes.
